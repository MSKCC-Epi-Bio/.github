# MSKCC-Epi-Bio

This GitHub organization hosts code, presentations and other resources created by members of Memorial Sloan Kettering's Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics.

The repositories in this organization provide resources for implementing competing risks survival analyses (`tidycmprsk`) and analyzing genomic data (`gnomeR`) and patient-reported outcomes (`PROscorerTools`) in R, implementing decision curves in python (`dcurves`), as well as a set of SAS macros for common tasks such as creating a Table 1 (`msk_SAS_macros`).
